## Introduction
Adversarial attacks pose a significant challenge to image retrieval systems, leading to inaccurate or maliciously manipulated results. CA-TRIDE proposes a robust framework to mitigate these challenges by leveraging collapse-aware mechanisms and triplet loss decoupling. Our method achieves:

- Enhanced retrieval robustness under adversarial settings.
- Improved performance on benign examples while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Features
- **Collapse-Aware**: Dynamically tracks collapseness to avoid model collapse.
- **Triplet Decouping**: Decouples attacks in Candidate Perturbation(CAP) and Anchor Perturbation(ANP) for stronger adversaries.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ca-tride.git
   cd ca-tride
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation
Download the datasets CUB, CARS and SOP from the official site or on Kaggle.


### Training
To train the model:
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```
Customize training parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and epochs in `config.yaml`.


## Results
The proposed CA-TRIDE achieves state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on standard benchmarks. Detailed results can be found in the `results/` folder and in our paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07364).
