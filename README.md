# Collapse-Aware Triplet Decoupling for Adversarially Robust Image Retrieval (CA-TRIDE)

## Overview
This repository provides the official implementation of **"Collapse-Aware Triplet Decoupling for Adversarially Robust Image Retrieval (CA-TRIDE)"**. The paper introduces a novel approach to enhance adversarial robustness in image retrieval systems through the innovative concept of collapse-aware triplet decoupling. You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07364).

## Introduction
Adversarial attacks pose a significant challenge to image retrieval systems, leading to inaccurate or maliciously manipulated results. CA-TRIDE proposes a robust framework to mitigate these challenges by leveraging collapse-aware mechanisms and triplet loss decoupling. Our method achieves:

- Enhanced retrieval robustness under adversarial settings.
- Improved performance on benign examples while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Features
- **Collapse-Aware**: Dynamically tracks collapseness to avoid model collapse.
- **Triplet Decouping**: Decouples attacks in Candidate Perturbation(CAP) and Anchor Perturbation(ANP) for stronger adversaries.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ca-tride.git
   cd ca-tride
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation
Download the datasets CUB, CARS and SOP from the official site or on Kaggle, and put them under the `datasets` folder, using the following names:
```
  cars/
  CUB_200_2011/
  Stanford_Online_Products/
```
### Training
To train the model through our CA-TRIDE, use `dataset:model:method' to train:
```bash
python train.py -C cub:rres18p:pgtripletN   #CUB
python train.py -C cars:rres18p:pgtripletN  #CARS
python train.py -C sop:rres18p:pgtripletN   #SOP
```
You can also change `rres18p` to other models to implement CA-TRIDE on other architecture, for example, use `rres50p` to train on ResNet50. (Note that we've only tested on ResNet18 models)

### Code Details
The main part of our code is located in `CA-TRIDE/defenses/pnp.py`. 

**Note:** use the corresponding `lambda` value before training. 

### Robustness Evaluation
To comprehensively evaluate the robustness of the trained model, you will need to run **10** different attacks upon the model through the following code:
```
#CA- Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A CA:pm=-:W=1:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#CA+ Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A CA:pm=+:W=1:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#QA- Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A QA:pm=-:M=1:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#QA+ Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A QA:pm=+:M=1:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#ES Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A ES:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#TMA Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A TMA:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#LTM Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A LTM:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#GTM Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A GTM:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]

#GTT Attack
python3 advrank.py -v -A GTT:eps=0.031372549:alpha=0.011764:pgditer=32 -C [YourModelCheckpoint]
```

After running each attack, you can calculate the **ERS** scores based on the paper [RobRank](https://github.com/cdluminate/robrank) or **ARS** according to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07364).
(Note that the ES attack accounts for **2** attacks.)
